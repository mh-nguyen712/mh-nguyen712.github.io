  abstract={In this paper, we propose new algorithms for
estimating micro-vibrations and correcting its effects in
satellite imaging with linear pushbroom camera. We first
design an accurate model of the acquisition process with
linear pushbroom camera, that incorporates the satellite
attitude as parameters. We then propose a two stage
reconstruction method based on an identification neural
network to identify the attitude, followed by a deep unrolled
network to correct the micro-vibrations. We then evalu-
ate the proposed framework on synthetic and real data,
showing promising results for this challenging problem.
Our results highlight the critical role of the focal plane’s
geometry, to improve the micro-vibrations identifiability
and therefore, the reconstruction quality.},
